R-code indicates code used for linear Blinder Oaxaca as well as testing other linear models such as Lasso and Ridge. I wanted to understand whether using highly dimensional models would provide benefit in the chance that penalisation models may be better, long-story short Lasso and Ridge were worse than XGBoost.
Python codes indicate the model training process and cross validation, and further analysis of common support assumption, distributions and other related inference.
